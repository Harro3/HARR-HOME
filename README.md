# HARR-HOME
An attempt at building a modular personnal assistant for my home ( as a discord bot)

Features:
- Expandable: easy API for adding commands
- Modular: only one file to change to connect to any kind of hardware (for now a senseHat)
- Convinient: No need to forward any ports, it can be accessed over the WEB on discord
